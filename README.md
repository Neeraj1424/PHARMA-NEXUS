An AI-powered dashboard that continuously monitors, analyzes, and predicts medicine quality based on various factors like expiry, storage conditions, supplier reliability, and historical data trends.  

  

How It Works  

  

Data Collection  

The system ingests data from hospital inventories, supplier logs, and real-time storage condition sensors (temperature, humidity, etc.). It integrates historical quality reports and external regulatory data to compare standards.  

  

AI & Data Analytics Processing  

Machine Learning algorithms analyze patterns in medicine degradation over time. Anomaly detection flags medicines with unusual storage conditions or mismatched expiry data. Supplier reliability analysis uses past records to predict the risk of poorquality supplies.  

Real-Time Alerts & Insights  

Alerts notify hospital staff about expired, poorly stored, or potentially counterfeit medicines. Predictive analytics helps hospitals forecast medicine quality issues before they occur.  

Interactive dashboards provide insights into medicine trends, usage patterns, and potential risks.
